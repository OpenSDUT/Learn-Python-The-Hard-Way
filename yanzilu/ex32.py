#Exercise 32:Loops and Lists

the_count = [1,2,3,4,5]
fruits = ['apples','oranges','pears','banana']
change = [1,'pennies',2,'dimes',3,'quarters']

#this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
for number in the_count:
	print "This is count %d" %number

#same as above
for fruit in fruits:
	print "A fruit of type:%s"%fruit

#also we can go through mixed lists too
#notice we have to use %r since we don't know what's in it
for i in change:
	print "I got %r"%i

#we can also build lists,first start with an empty one
elements = []

#then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
for i in range(0,6):
	print "Adding %d to the list."% i
	#append is a function that lists understand
	elements.append(i)

#now we can print them out too
for i in elements:
	print "Element was : %d" % i
